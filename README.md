How to play!

The invasion of Blockatron is a top-down shooter game which has taken inspiration from spaceinvaders and the classic breakout game.
The goal of the game is to kill as many blockatrons as you can before they overpower you and take you down. You controll a human spaceship outside the atmosphere of blockatronia, the blockatron homeworld. Your ship is equipped with a highpowered railgun which you can fire using space. When a blockatron is destroyed there is a chance that it will drop one of the following upgrades:

Bullet speed
Ship speed
Weapon cooldown reduction
Weapon damage
Once you've destroyed an entire wave of enemies a new one will spawn. The enemies in this new wave will be stronger and faster.
